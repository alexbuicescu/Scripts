Just to sum up to the Brenden's answer, the real problem is with the libsdl1.2 package, as stated in this bug report[0].

The solution is ready, but somehow isn't available on default Ubuntu package sources yet (at least not for me). So, a way to solve this is to import the developer PPA and install the patched package directly:

sudo apt-add-repository ppa:timo-jyrinki/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian
You can later remove the PPA with:

sudo apt-get install ppa-purge
sudo ppa-purge ppa:timo-jyrinki/ppa

This solved the problem for me, in a gnome-shell environment (which uses gdm).
